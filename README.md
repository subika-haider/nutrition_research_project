# Nutrition Research Project
Our journey began with a simple yet profound question: How does the nutritional value of a recipe influence its cooking time? Through meticulous analysis of a sizable number of recipes, we've embarked on a quest to unravel the intricate relationship between the healthiness of dishes and the time they take to prepare.

### Introduction
The "Recipes & Ratings" dataset consists of a collection of recipes, each accompanied by detailed information including cooking time, nutritional values, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to uncover insights that could potentially influence dietary choices and cooking habits.

For the purpose of this analysis, we define healthy recipes as those that align with specific nutritional guidelines, such as lower amounts of saturated fats, sugars, and sodium, while being higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Unhealthy recipes, on the other hand, are characterized by higher levels of saturated fats, sugars, sodium, and calories, offering lower nutritional value per serving.

It's important to note that this distinction is somewhat simplified for the purposes of this project. The actual healthiness of a recipe can depend on various factors, including individual dietary needs and overall eating patterns.

The central question of our project is: Is there a statistically significant difference in average cooking times between healthy and unhealthy recipes?

This question is grounded in the broader context of dietary choices and meal preparation habits. Understanding whether healthier recipes require more or less time to prepare compared to their unhealthy counterparts could have implications for public health initiatives, dietary advice, and individuals' willingness to adopt healthier eating habits.

The relationship between the healthiness of a recipe and its cooking time is relevant for several reasons:

- Dietary Choices: Time constraints are often cited as a barrier to healthy eating. If healthier recipes are found to have comparable or shorter cooking times, this could encourage more people to make healthier dietary choices.
- Meal Planning: Insights from this analysis could help individuals and families in planning meals that are both nutritious and time-efficient.
- Public Health: Understanding the factors that influence dietary habits is crucial for designing effective public health campaigns and nutritional guidelines.

The dataset contains several thousand rows, each representing a unique recipe. For our analysis, the following columns are particularly relevant:

- Cooking Time: The total time required to prepare and cook the recipe.
- Nutritional Information: This includes data on calories, fats, sugars, sodium, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It is crucial for determining whether a recipe is healthy or unhealthy according to our criteria.
- Servings: This information is important for normalizing nutritional values and ensuring that comparisons are fair.

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to shed light on the relationship between the nutritional value of recipes and their preparation time. This could have important implications for dietary habits, meal planning, and public health initiatives. Understanding whether there is a significant difference in cooking times between healthy and unhealthy recipes can provide valuable insights for individuals striving to make healthier dietary choices without sacrificing convenience.
